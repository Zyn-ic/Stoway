# Warning

This is a work in progress branch and is not yet ready for production use. It is recommended to use this system as a reference for your own inventory system. This branch covers a complete rewrite from the old server system and is using the Fusion framework to help with the client system to have near instant update times. This branch is not recommended for use in a production environment, please refer to the main branch for code that might come from this branch but download from <a href="https://github.com/Zyn-ic/Stoway/releases">latest release</a> for stable production ready code.
